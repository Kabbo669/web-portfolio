      <p class="about-nishat">Nishat is one of the most prominent person in his village. He is a young man with a dream to become a "Chairman" in his Union to serve the people with his exellence and hard working attitude as well as to help them from government site. Currently he is working as a family man. Besides he inspired people to serve for the country. Though he didn't marry yet but he is an experienced person about women body structure which knowledge he gained from his cousin Sijan. He helps people with all his capability and limitations . In this poin of view he is good man with kind heart and manner. But there are some calamny too, as we know the proverb that there are no unmixed good. Like this proverb the most henious addiction of him is to women and wine. Though it can be said that this is a matter of age, but the fact is perspective. Everyone should think his situation about the perspective of his beloved person as well as religious perspective. So, he should learn some moral courage about society and family. It is called that a person with this type of perspective is a person without moral courage, humanity and void of moral dignity. Moreover, there are some faults from the women side too. After knowing everything about a person the women who get attached with him , I don't think so that these women have any charecter to be mention too. Furthermore, when a bachelor boy get this type of chance to be attached with a girl, obviously he will take the chance except angel. So, everyone should think about the matter to correct himself and to established him in society as a respectable person.................
